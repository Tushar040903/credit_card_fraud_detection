## Features

- Analyze credit card transaction data
- Preprocess and clean the transaction data
- Train machine learning models for fraud detection
- Evaluate model performance and accuracy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tushar040903/credit_card_fraud_detection.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection

## Data Collection
The credit card transaction data used in this project is sourced from a reputable dataset. Ensure you have downloaded the dataset and placed it in the data directory. The dataset should be in CSV format.

## Model Training
Fraud detection models are trained using supervised learning techniques on labeled transaction data. The script credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb handles the training process.

## Results
Model evaluation metrics and fraud detection results are analyzed and saved. Use the analyze_results.py script to visualize and interpret the model's performance.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request for improvements or bug fixes.
